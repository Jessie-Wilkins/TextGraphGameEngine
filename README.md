# TextGraphGameEngine
The TextGraphGameEngine is a game engine that specializes in supporting text-based or ASCII character graphical games. In future iterations, it will allow for quick implementation of text graphics, the manipulation or "physics" of the text characters, the logic of the games, the sound, and even the artificial intelligence. Games that can be created with the aid of the engine include 
Rogue-like games, simple platformers, and abstract simulations.
